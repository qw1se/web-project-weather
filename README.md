## Overview

Weather App is a lightweight, dependency-free web application that demonstrates how to build a responsive, accessible UI using native web technologies (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript). The app fetches current weather data for a searched city, displays essential metrics, and shows the location's local time. The project emphasizes clarity, performance, and a clean visual design suitable for learning, portfolio presentation, or embedding into larger sites.

Key points:
- Minimal and intuitive interface with a single search input.
- Clear separation of concerns: network & time logic in script.js, styles in styles.css.
- Designed to be easily extensible (forecasts, unit toggles, geolocation, caching).

## Features

- City search: lookup weather for any city worldwide via a single input (keyboard-friendly).

- Responsive design: adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop with CSS media queries and flexible units.

- Lightweight & framework-free: built with vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) and modern CSS — no heavy dependencies.  
- Robust UX: loading indicators and graceful error handling.  
- Extensible: easy to add Celsius/Fahrenheit toggles, multi-day forecasts, service worker support, or geolocation.
